I'm an annotation use to generate some Table of contents. 

I have this form : 

${toc:depthLevel=x|level=y}$

The depthLevel is use to know the min level of title i need to use. I'll not print title lower than x.

The level is use to know what i need to print. I stay on the section x-1 and I stop at the next y title.
