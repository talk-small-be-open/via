I'm an abstract class. I allows the transformation of a tree. I'll visit a tree and if a node need to be transform i'll replace the node by his transformation.

The top node is the root of the tree i need to transform.

The replacement is a Stack with all the nodes of the branch of the node I'm visiting.
