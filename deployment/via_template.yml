# Main configuration file for your via installation via Ansible
#

via:

  # ===== BASIC SETTINGS ==============


  gemStoneVersion: "3.5.1"

  # Location of the source code (default github main repository)
  # Once in the format of git-SSH, once in the format of Metacello (Pharo internal)
  baseRepository:
    gitUrl: "https://github.com/talk-small-be-open/via.git"
#    metacelloUrl: "github://talk-small-be-open/via"

  # The part of the source code which is custom to your via instance site
  siteRepository:
    gitUrl: "https://github.com/talk-small-be-open/via-site-template.git"
    metacelloUrl: "github://talk-small-be-open/via-site-template"


  # Your organization names
  organizationName: 'My Cool Organization'
  organizationShortName: 'MCO'

  # Your domain of the web application (Must be reachable in your network!). Example: media.myorg.com
  appDomain: "your.host.domain"

  # Domain where your organization emails are from. Example: myorg.com
  emailDomain: "email.host.domain"

  # Email address of the via Administrator. Use your own email, I guess.
  adminEmail: "you@email.host.domain"

  # Via does not send emails directly. It will forward it to an SMTP server
  # You probably should have an SMTP inhouse, anyway. If you need SMTP-authentication,
  # set the configuration options in the admin backend of via.
  # Example: smtp.myorg.com
  smtpRelayhost: "your.smtp.host.domain"

  # Which authentication and user provider do you use? (Choose from: local, google, facebook).
  identityProviders: [local, google, facebook]

  # Internal port where the application gem will be listening
  gemPorts: [8087, 8088, 8089]

  # ===== ADVANCED SETTINGS (Leave them untouched, if unsure) ==============

  # Should your via instance be reachable by HTTPS? Certificates are being generated automatically with certbot (let's encrypt)
  # Works only if the domain is public, because certbot will validate the domain online.
  useSsl: true

  # Is your via instance not ready for production? If you would like to hide your application behind an extra HTTP basic authentication, use this feature.
  # HTTP Basic Auth Username is "betatester", choose password here:
  isBeta: false
  betaPassword: "beta"

  # Alternative domain name
  appDomain2: "alternative.host.domain"
  
  # Installation folder of via application
  installationPath: "/opt/via"

  # Use this, if you need to set the privat key of your servers user
  # sshPrivateKey: !vault |
  #   $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
  #   PUT YOUR ENCRYPTED TEXT HERE
